Welcome to **Your Project Name**! This is a RESTful API written in Rust using the Actix-Web framework. This README will guide you on how to set up and run the API on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you'll need the following tools installed on your machine:

- Rust Programming Language (1.55 or later): [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Cargo (Rust Package Manager): It comes bundled with Rust.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the RESTful API on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. Run the API:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

   This will start the API server, and you should see output similar to:

   ```
   Starting server at http://127.0.0.1:8080
   ```

Congratulations! The RESTful API is now up and running on your machine. You can access it at `http://localhost:8080` (or the address displayed in the output).

## Usage

- The API endpoints are defined in the source code files inside the `src` directory. Feel free to modify or add more endpoints to suit your needs.

- You can use tools like `curl`, Postman, or any other REST client to interact with the API and test the endpoints.
